## Notes

Since this was the first time I interact with the android studio, I had to teach myself about the Kotlin file and the interaction between the gradle file. A lot of things were different since I never worked with the program that has this much interaction between classes and classes of each program files(I used to work with java, and I used to code programs that has only few interactions between classes and classes). Moreover, my pc had different condition from the video's pc; therefore, it took a long time to download android studio(I learned how to open BIOS and to turn on VT). After those, for the coding wise, it took a long time for me to understand and comprehend why the person in the video wrote that code and how that one line of code interact with another code and visualize on the phone's screen. The hardes part was trying to remember those learnings. I had to wrote tons of additional notes and footprints of what I coded and what I deleted so that when I have problem about this same style of coding, I can look at my code and bring back my memory. However, at the same time, I had fun since I solved some of the curious questions while learning coding from univeristy since university did not teach me how to code in industrial way yet(such as interacting with the design of the application or the rule of marking in code). I was wondering how people organize extreme amount of files and the notes wrote by programmer and https://github.com/ribot/android-guidelines/blob/master/project_and_code_guidelines.md
reading through this website helped me solving quesiton. Another question is how the program itself save the program that user interacted(like clicking and adding) and save it as a folder so it does not disappear even after the application is shutted(I had this quesiton since while digging through some of the games that I love, everytime I get new item or save or talk, new folder or line of code created and saved what I did). While going through this, I was so happy that I can also do this(partially) now on android studio. I hope I can extend my learning about android stuio coding since this is way too much fun than I expected.
